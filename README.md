🌍 Multilingual Language Translator with Speech Output 🎙️
This is a Python-based project that translates text between major world languages and reads the translated text aloud using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). It uses pretrained Hugging Face MarianMT models for translation and provides an interactive interface via Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab using ipywidgets.

🔧 Features

🌐 Supports 9 major languages:
English, Hindi, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Arabic
🤖 Translates using Hugging Face MarianMT models
🗣️ Speaks translated text aloud using gTTS
🖼️ Interactive UI built with ipywidgets
⚡ Caches models to avoid re-downloading and improve performance

💡 What You’ll Learn
